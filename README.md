# RimWorld Cheat Menu – Total Control Over Your Colony 🏗️💀

## Introduction

RimWorld is known for chaos: disease outbreaks, mechanoid raids, food shortages, and colonists who snap after one insult. 😤 If you’re done fighting RNG and ready to build your colony *your way*, it’s time to open the **RimWorld Cheat Menu** — a powerful in-game panel packed with tools to control every aspect of the game.

From god mode to full colonist editing, instant building, infinite supplies, and raid spawning — the cheat menu is like having a dev console with a UI.

## What Is the RimWorld Cheat Menu?

The **cheat menu** is an in-game modded interface (or built-in dev mode) that lets you tweak, spawn, destroy, heal, or upgrade anything in your RimWorld map. It’s not just for testing — it’s a sandbox tool for players who want full control, instant results, and creative freedom.

No coding. No console commands. Just one menu with all the power.
